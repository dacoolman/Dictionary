# Dictionary

The challenge was to create a dictionary app that would tell you the definition of a word. Using a dictionary json file 
I had to store every word into a trie based on it's letter. The definition would be stored on the last character for each word. 
I would then use a hash function to store the root of each trie based on the first letter, and find that root based on the word
that was entered. 

My file is located at: hash_table/js/hash_table.js
